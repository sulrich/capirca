# Arista Traffic-Policy Use Notes

# supported tokens

The following tokens are supported:
 - `action`
 - `comment`
 - `counter`
 - `destination-address`
 - `destination-exclude`
 - `destination-port`
 - `destination-prefix` - this should resolve to a configured field-set in traffic-policy format.
 - `fragment-offset`
 - `icmp-type`
 - `logging`
- `option`
   - `established`
   - `tcp-established`
   - `initial`
   - `rst`
   - `first-fragment` - this  will be rendered as a `fragment` match.`
 - `packet-length`
 - `source-address`
 - `source-exclude`
 - `source-port`
 - `source-prefix` - this should resolve to a configured field-set in traffic-policy format.
 - `verbatim`



# filter types
Traffic-policies are dual-address-family by default (i.e.: mixed).  A term may be either of type ipv4 or ipv6.  If the filter type is defined as mixed (the default), then match/action statements for each address family will be generated.  If the operator wishes to create an ipv4 or ipv6 only filter, the inet and inet6 tokens within the header will be honored and only addresses from the respective address family will be rendered.  However, EOS will still, by default, create an 'ipvX-default-all' term for the alternate address family.  (see below)

## action
The fully supported actions are: `accept`, and `deny`.  Use of `reject`, or `reject-with-tcp-rst` will result in the generation of deny actions in the rendered traffic policy.

### counters
- If counters are specified in a term, a traffic-policy named-counter stanza will be generated in the rendered output.
- Counter names should not contain a (`.`). If a (`.`) is embedded in a counter name it will be replaced w/a dash (`-`).

### (source|destination)-address-exclude
Currently, (as of Jan-2021), EOS does not support the use of 'except' inline within match statements.  If an exclude/except token is used, a traffic-policy field-set will be generated and referenced in the match-term output. This field-set will be named `<direction>-<term.name>` where direction is either **src** or **dst** depending on the direction of the token in use.

If the filter type is mixed, both address-families will have the respective field-sets generated. The field-set for the ipv4 address family will have the field-set generated with no suffix, while the ipv6 field-set will have `_v6` appended.

## default-terms

EOS has (2) default terms per traffic-policy, one for each address family:
- `ipv4-default-all`
- `ipv6-default-all`

If there is no match criteria associated with a term _and_ the term name in the policy begins with `default-`, the contents will be rendered into the default terms for the appropriate address family.

## empty match criteria
if there is no match criteria specified, and the term name does _not_ start with `default-` the term will not be rendered and a warning will be logged.
